# plasma-splash-arch-moe
Fork of [Plasma Splash Screen for Archlinux, Moe Themed](https://github.com/perigoso/plasma-splash-arch-moe)

Updated with SVGs to accommodate high resolution displays and a slightly darker background to really make the colors pop (see the [svg](https://github.com/nickgirga/plasma-splash-arch-moe/tree/svg) branch for updated images and the [darker](https://github.com/nickgirga/plasma-splash-arch-moe/tree/darker) branch for updated images and a darker background)

### NEW!
There is now a Fedora version that can be found on the [Fedora branch](https://github.com/nickgirga/plasma-splash-arch-moe/tree/fedora). It is based on the [darker branch](https://github.com/nickgirga/plasma-splash-arch-moe/tree/darker) and likely will never have a non-dark version (as this is how I prefer it anyways). You are free to revert the color changes and create a [merge request](https://github.com/nickgirga/plasma-splash-arch-moe/compare) of the lighter version again and I will likely accept it, but I personally have no interest in doing it myself.
